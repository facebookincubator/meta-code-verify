Code Verify is an extension for verifying the integrity of a web page.

The idea is you can publish what JavaScript should appear on your site into a "manifest". The manifest consists of the hashes of all the JavaScript files in a given release. This browser extension can consume the manifest and verify that *only* that code executes, or else display a warning to the user.
